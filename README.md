Certainly! For your project, I'll craft a README.md that outlines its purpose, how to compile and run it, and its functionality. You can adjust the content to better fit your project's specifics or add more sections as needed.

# System Information Gatherer

## Overview

This project is a C++ application designed to gather and display system information for Linux-based systems. It provides detailed information about the CPU, GPU, memory, storage, the Linux distribution, desktop environment, and window manager. It uses various system commands to collect this information, then saves it to a file and displays the contents on the console.

## Features

- Gather detailed system information including:
  - CPU Information
  - GPU Information
  - Memory Usage
  - Storage Information
  - Linux Distribution Details
  - Desktop Environment
  - Window Manager
- Save the gathered information to a file
- Display the gathered information from the file on the console

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this application, ensure you have the following installed:
- A Linux-based operating system
- g++ compiler
- Basic command line utilities (`lscpu`, `lspci`, `free`, `df`, and access to `/etc/os-release`)

## Compilation

Compile the application using the g++ compiler by executing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
g++ sysinfo -o main.cpp
```


## Usage

After compilation, you can run the application by executing the generated executable in the terminal:

```bash
./sysinfo
```

The application will gather the system information, save it to a file named `sysinfo.txt`, and then read and display this information on the console.

## How It Works

The application executes various system commands through the C++ `popen` function, capturing their outputs. This information is then written to a specified file (default `sysinfo.txt`). After saving, it reads the file content and displays it on the console.
